                    The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is a historic fort in Delhi, India.
                    It was constructed by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the mid-17th century.
                    The fort's red sandstone walls give it its name, and it served as the main residence
                    of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. The Red Fort is a significant symbol of
                    India's rich history and cultural heritage and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                    It is a popular tourist attraction, and every year, the Indian Prime Minister raises
                    the national flag here on Independence Day (15th August).
